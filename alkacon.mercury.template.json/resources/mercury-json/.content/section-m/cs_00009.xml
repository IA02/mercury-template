      <content><![CDATA[<p>In version 12, OpenCms introduces a JSON API. With the JSON API, OpenCms is no longer just a content management system for building and maintaining websites, but also a management system for mobile application content. Mobile applications typically provide a combination of useful features but also up-to-date information. Areas with information changes regularly and contribute to mobile applications being used more often.</p>
<p>When content changes, it is obviously desirable not to have to publish a new version of an application every time. Rather, it should be possible to always retrieve news items that are up-to-date via a service interface. The presentation and formatting should also be variably adaptable by an editorial team according to the actual content.</p>
<p>The JSON API of OpenCms can be used as a service interface for mobile content. Editorial teams can use OpenCms to create content for mobile applications and publish it on a scheduled basis, without the need for an additional mobile editorial system.</p>]]></content>
