      <content><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, contents are arranged manually on a website, sometimes contents are published in the form of dynamic lists with pagination, filtering and sorting, e.g., all articles on a certain topic that have been published in the last week.</p>
<p>Content lists in OpenCms are realized via so called list configurations. The results of such list configurations can either be shown on websites and now also in mobile applications.</p>
<p>Application developers have the possibility to retrieve content lists configured by editorial teams via the JSON API and to dynamically change filter and sort criteria using the request parameters.</p>]]></content>
